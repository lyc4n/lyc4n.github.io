# ES2015 Cheatsheet

## let vs const (and the old var)
___

Both `let` and `const` are **much safer** than `var` because it scopes the declaration 
within the nearest block.


### let

- Use for variable that can be reassigned

### const

- Can't be reassigned
- Value has to be set upon declaration

### var

- This what we used during the previous version of Javascript.
- It does [variable hoisting](http://lyc4n.github.io/2016/06/12/til-js-variable-hoisting/) where it internally moves the declaration(not including the assignment) of the variable from within a function into the top of the method allowing it to
  be used even before it is declared.
