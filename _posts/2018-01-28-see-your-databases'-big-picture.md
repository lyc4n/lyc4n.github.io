Whenever I get into a new or got back to an old Rails project that I have
worked with sometime ago I try to get the big picture of the system first.
The way I do this is through the use of the
[rails-erd](https://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd) gem.

[rails-erd](https://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd) creates an Entity
Relationship Diagram formatted as a pdf based from your project's models and their relationships
therefore making it easier for us to see the overall view of the system from
the database side.
