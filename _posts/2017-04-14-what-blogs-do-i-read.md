title: What blogs do I read?
---

A coleague (a younger dev) asks me what blogs do I read. I thought I'd answer
with a blog post of my own and here it is. :facepunch:

I don't really have a set of tech blogs that I read on a daily basis. What I do
is I subscribe on newsletters of weekly currated blog post and try do devote a
time within the week where I browse them and take a look at those that
interests me. That said, here are the newsletters that I am subscribed right
now:

- [Web Development Reading List](https://wdrl.info/)
- [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)
- [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/)

Aside from those, twitter also helps. Lots of open source contributors are
active on it so I check twitter once in a while!

Oh, another thing. Aside from blogs, podcasts are also helpful. I remember I used to
listen to [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues) and [Giant Robots](http://giantrobots.fm/)
podcasts though I haven't been lately.

Thanks to the people behind those newsletter for keeping us well informed.
If you're generous enough please buy them :beers:! That it, subscribe to those things above if you haven't yet. :smile:
