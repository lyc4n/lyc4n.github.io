Couple of years ago, my first laptop broke down. After that I decided to get a
desktop instead which I use until now. But for the past few months I've been
thinking of buying a dev machine since I moved out from home into a place closer to
work. I had a hard time deciding whether it should be a Macbook Pro since I use this
most of the time at work or a Macbook Air for it's portability and of course
the budget :smile:.

I would definitely love to have an apple product as my development and personal
machine but find them too pricey for now and as a person who have been using
ubunu for the past few years now I'd happily pick a non Apple machine as long
as it's specifications are enough for my use cases :wink:.

So I browsed some of online shops and found then bought a pre used Thinkpad T430 with 16gb of RAM,
240gb of SSD storage, and 1gb of videocard. Keyboard is not backlit but it does
have a flashlight kind of thing that does the job of a keyboard lighting and it
feels pretty cool got it half the price of a pre used Macbook Pro that has
almost the same hardware specifications. Feels like I'm getting my money's
worth. Hopefully nothing goes wrong since I have only using it now for a few
days.

As of the installation I had a trouble installating Ubuntu 16.04 via DVD but it
was successful when I used a bootable flash drive.

To end I'd like to say that it feels so much more motivating to do some programming in
a laptop over a desktop! So get one(whatever you prefer of course) if you are a developer
who wants to get something done on your weekends! :grin:
