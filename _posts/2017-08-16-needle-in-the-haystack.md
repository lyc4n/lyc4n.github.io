title: Needle in the haystack
---

Catchy article title huh? I won't be discussing how I found needles on the haystack but
something that developers and other workers encounter every once in a while
which is a somehow comparable to the needle in the haystack.

Simple scenario is that you've got two files with almost identical contents.
That probably is code, json data, xml data and the likes. Now you want to know
that difference between those files. You could easily solve this by using a
text diff finder online or using built in commands available in your machine
such as diff. Those stuff works but there'll be times when their results aren't
that easy to understand and will take some time off you before you realize the
difference between the file. A trick you can use is simply load those two files
in your editor in different tabs and switch between the tabs. You'll easily
notice the part of that file that made the difference without a sweat!
