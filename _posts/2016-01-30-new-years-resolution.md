This github.io page of mine has been stucked for so long until today!
But I've decided to utilize it for sharing things I encouter
in my daily development adventures since I believe it would also help me be a
better developer while sharing information to others. This year I feel more disciplined than ever
to make this a habit. Mark my words! Well yeah thats forcing myself to commit. So see you around!
