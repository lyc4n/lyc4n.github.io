title: "Opinion: Why Ruby > Python"
---

Last month I got the chance to play with Python and some of the major
frameworks built with it. In the process I learned why Ruby is greater than
Python.

1. Ruby is much more Programmer friendly than Python:
2. 4 lines of indentation is simply too much
3. Ruby tools are more modern than Python tools
4. Main web development framework Rails has larger community compared to Django
5. Python devs are divided between new and old versions
6. Unlike Ruby you have to explicitly add () when calling a method
7. Ruby is more object oriented than Python

PS: This of course is a biased opinion coming from someone who have done Ruby
programming for a few years and a few weeks of Python programming. There are surely
reasons why Python > Ruby but I'm not leaning towards that topic.
