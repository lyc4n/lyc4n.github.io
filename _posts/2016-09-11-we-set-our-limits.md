title: We set our limits

A little over three years ago I graduated from college and applied for a job as a Programmer.
I passed the initial test which is on paper and then proceeded on a two day internship
which involved practical programming among other stuffs.

I was able to solve most of the problem except the last one. It just **seem too
difficult for me at that time** (and I believed in this for quite some time) as if I had
to slay a wild flying dragon just with a knife. Fortunately I still got the job, but
I never looked back at that dragon like a scared little baby believing that it would
devour me alive or toast me with it's breathe of fire.

Yesterday, I remembered that Dragon and thought that keeping it somehow affects 
my confidence with my skill as a developer. Finally **I decided to get my hands
dirty and stifle the beast from the past** in order to get rid of that limit that I set
upon myself. **AND FINALLY I DID IT**.

The challenge is to display a number spiral based on a number n. For example
the input is 3. We need to have the following as a result:

    9 8 7
    2 1 6
    3 4 5

3 X 3 is 9 and starting from the upper left we put 9 moving clockwise and
priting then next lower number every step until we write the number 1 in the
screen.

Here is my solution:

Yes we can! :gem: :doughnut: :ice_cream: :beers:
